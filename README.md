# HP-PPL_Game-2048

classic game 2048 in HP Prime Programming Language

### Important Note
The rules of it is a little different from the classic one: The generated blocks contain 2, 4 and 8 instead of normal 2 or 4 (this will get the game even more funny as far as I tested), you can customize it in line 140.

### Controls and Features

| Key / Action | Function Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Number 1** | Press it and the board will rotate. (This one won't break the the game balance) |
| **Touch** | You can touch to move the blocks but it still be experimental. |
| **Key "+"** | Switch the theme of the game. We provide many kinds of theme, like yellow2red, light green, green, purple2blue, blue, and a special theme for better scores. |
| **Backspace** | Use backspace to start a new game. |
| **Space** | Use to record the score instantly and show the highest score recorded. |
| **Key "esc"** | Exit the game. |

### Scoring and Recording
You don't have to worry about if your score has recorded, because we will do that when you start a new game or use the key "esc" to exit the game.

Hope you like it!
